The level of rigor is high but the pay off is even higher. You can be certain that if you're studying Arabic here you will learn much and will have many instructors ready to help at a moments notice. The location in the old Medina is also really convenient for shopping and touring the history of the area as there are many famous sites such as Bab Mansour and the king's palace within walking distance from the center.
